`z3.rkt`: Racket bindings for Z3
================================

We aim to provide a reasonably complete and *easy-to-use* implementation of Z3
on Racket. The documentation is rather incomplete right now, but here's what's
working:

* Basic assertions on integers, booleans, arrays and integer lists
* Custom datatypes: only scalar datatypes supported right now
* Extracting values from generated models
* A few examples, including Sudoku, n-queens, and bounded model checking for quicksort

Check out the `tests` and `examples` subdirectories for examples. For a
slightly more involved example, see [numbermind](https://github.com/sid0/numbermind),
a small web app written using this library.

Important things to do:

* Better model navigation
* Assertions on other types of lists and other non-scalar datatypes
* More examples, a more comprehensive test suite
* Better debugging and printing

Pull requests are always welcome!

submitted to TFP'12.
